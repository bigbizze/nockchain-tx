These are v1 transaction features for more advanced functionality:

## Lock Merkle Proofs
Proves you can spend a UTXO by showing a path from your lock (spending condition) to the lock root hash stored in the note. Without this, you can't prove ownership of inputs. **Critical for spending existing notes.**

## Witness Structure
Segregates signatures from transaction data (like Bitcoin's SegWit). Maps public key hashes to (public key, signature) pairs. **Required for v1 transactions but v0 works without it.**

## Note Data/Metadata
Arbitrary key-value data attached to outputs - could store NFT metadata, contract state, etc. **Optional - only needed for applications beyond simple value transfer.**

**Importance:**
- For basic wallet functionality (receiving funds, creating new transactions): Current implementation works
- For spending existing UTXOs: Need merkle proofs
- For full v1 compatibility: Need witness structure
- For advanced features: Need note data

Your current implementation can:
- Generate valid signatures ✓
- Create new transactions ✓
- Cannot yet: Spend existing chain UTXOs (needs proofs)

For a minimal wallet, you'd want to add merkle proofs next. The witness structure and note data can wait unless you specifically need v1 transactions or metadata features.
